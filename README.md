# unoAI

This is our submission of QuHacks 2026

We created an AI-powered UNO game. It allows you to play on various difficulties, from competitive to casual. Not only can you play with just one person, but you can indulge in endless UNO fun.

1. Clone repository
2. Make .venv
3. Activate .venv
4. Install requirements.txt
5. Go to https://ai.hackclub.com/keys and create an API KEY (only works if you are part of Hack Club)
6. Make .env and write... API_URL = "paste it here" and API_KEY = "paste it here"
7. Run reshuffle-server.js
8. Run python api.py
9. Assuming live server extension is installed, open index.html with live server
